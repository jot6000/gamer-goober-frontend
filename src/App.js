  summary: "The imposter is on spaceship!!!! who is sus...? You will find out when you find the sus guy on the susship in the suspace. Maybe you are imposter..???? Or maybe imposter is friend along the way,,!! :))",
  review: "The ending was way too sus for what the film was trying to do in the first half. I was under the assumption created by the movie that the sus guy was red, but, and spoilers to anyone who hasn't watched it, it turns out the imposter was the main character, 'blue'. What a boring and frustrating ending.",

  name: "The Leg Movie",
  rating: "7/10",
  summary: "The leg movie is about the leg bricks moving around and they are legging a lot. The leg man called L Bozo wants to be master Legger. He defeats the evil Arm man and wins and then he kiss the Leg girlfriend and then he become the master Legger.",
  review: "The amount of leg shown in the movie is way too little. They we constantly showing the story and backstory of the Arm man which is frustrating to anyone coming to see Legs. I still gave it a 7 because L Bozo's storyline is unbelievably intricately written, his Leg girlfriend is so simplistic yet resembles any love interest the viewer may have.",
